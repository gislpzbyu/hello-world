# Overview

This project is a simple "Hello World" program created to begin my personal software portfolio.  
The purpose is to practice using GitHub for version control, document my work, and demonstrate a basic program.  

The software prints the message "Hello World!" along with my name to the console. This project marks the starting point of building a portfolio that will showcase growth and learning as a software engineer.
